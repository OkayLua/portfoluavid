                    <p>Show Your Face is another project from the minor Visual Interface Design at the University of
                        Applied Sciences Amsterdam. In this class we delved deeper into typography and made a site for a
                        choosen font. In my case Frutiger.</p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Learning about typography and giving a font an identity.</p>
            <div>
                <p>For this project I first went out on the streets and took pictures of font's that spoke to me. For
                    these series of photo's I had a theme in mind, Fonts used in public transport.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    After collecting and analysing all photo's, I realised that most of them had one thing in common:
                    Wheter is was the Amsterdam Metro System, the Rotterdam Metro System, my local bus or the NS; Most
                    of them used the same font, It was either fruitger or an adaptation of frutiger.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>About <span>the project</span></h2>
                <p>After thoroughly researching Frutiger and his font, it was time to put my knowledge to work and
                    create a website with fitting identity for the font, or well Show My Face.
                </p>
                <h3>Why Frutiger?</h3>
                <p>I've been a huge fan of public transport for the longest time, Especially trains. Which is why I
                    picked it as my topic for the photos. Frutiger is used by a lot of instances for its great
                    legibility while still having a open en inviting feel. It's a typeface originally made for the
                    Charles de Gaulle</p>
                <h3>The website</h3>
                <p>For the website I wanted to created a very simple and clean look, Representing the usage of the face.
                    For this I took elements usage in signage from Schiphol Airport (where they also used Frutiger) and
                    the colors from Nessie, The design system from NS. Combining this resulted in a fun but a still very
                    clean design showcasing the history and different aspects of the Frutiger Typeface. </p>

            <h2>The <span>site</span></h2>
            <p>The site was made in Framer, A tool that I am trying to get more familiar with so I thought it would be a
                nice challenge to try it! It ended up working pretty well and the website is up and running. You can take a look at it throught the link below.</p>
