                    <p>Vinyl depot is the first project in a line of works made for the minor Visual Interaction Design
                        for CMD.
                        It's a online product that helps people find new and second-hand Vinyl and accessories in a
                        different and fun way.</p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Discovering new and second-hand vinyl in a new and innovating way. </p>
            <div>
                <p>Vinyl depot is a new online platform that helps people discover new and second vinyl and accessories
                    in a new way. Instead of regular catalogs full of music you can filter through hundreds of LP’s in a
                    different way: Filter on type of vinyl case, color, quantity and mood or genre.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The mood filter exists out of 3 scales: Emotion, Intensity and Amplification. Each combination of
                    the three gives a new unique selection of LP’s allowing users to discover new gems that they
                    otherwise would’ve never heard of.</p>

                <h2>Interface <span>& Interaction</span></h2>
                <p>The challenge for this project was finding and experimenting with different and innovating kinds of
                    filtering and searching. A Challenge in which I would say I did a pretty good job at. Vinyl Depot is
                    all about discovering music. Mostly based on less standard aspects of vinyl like the quantity of
                    discs, the color of the vinyl, the mood, amplification and more.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It's a unique experience that more focuses on new music and new favourites than just finding a place to buy a vinyl that you already know.</p>

                <h2>Filtering <span>& Control</span></h2>
                <p>VinylDepot is not just any webshop. It's an experience, making online shopping for Vinyl's just as
                    fun as in store by adding two simple elements.</p>
                <h3>Immersive Filters</h3>
                <p>Vinyl Depot has several unique filters that keeps users in full control while also surprising them
                    with the results. This keeps it playful while still making sure that the users knows what is going
                    on and feels like the are the one calling the shots.</p>
                <h3>The store at home</h3>
                <p>Just like in those old store, the results are indexed in a long “wall” of vinyls. Bringing that fun
                    browsing experience right to your laptop. By using progressive disclosure it makes sure, once again,
                    that users are in full control.</p>

                    and giving the user a good impression of the UX and the branding.
