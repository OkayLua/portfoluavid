                    too far. There, itâ€™s unhealthily often about our mental health." <span class="empsidenote">Opening

                <p>The website is a based on an excellent article written by Nina Polak called <a target="_blank"
                        href="https://decorrespondent.nl/14491/moeten-we-niet-wat-minder-over-onze-geestelijke-gezondheid-praten/24ce48f0-ec00-0585-0f77-a0be7f05884c">Moeten
                        we niet wat minder over onze Mentale Gezondheid praten?</a> This artictle discusses the problems
                    in the way we talk about Mental Health nowadays, exploring the problems in the language we use.
                    It's an article that really spoke to me and inspired me to make this project in which I, not only
                    discuss these problems brought up in the article, I also allow readers to immideatly make changes in
                    their vocabulary by implementing interactive elements. </p>

            <h2>The <span>Article</span></h2>
            <div>
                <p>The process began with extensive research into the content of the article and understanding the
                    difficulties we are facing these days regarding mental Health Discussion. In case you don't feel
                    like reading the entire article, I have made a quick summary on the side here.</p>
                <h3>How it's going <span>now</span></h3>
                <p>Therapytalk (Using clinic terms in regular conversations) is ubiquitous. Words like OCD, Autism,
                    Depression etc. are overly used in regular day-to-day conversations. A dangerous practice scine it
                    can allow people to wrongfully understand certain illnesses as well as wrongfully self-diagnose. The
                    Covid-19 pandemic and Social Media were and are a huge catalyst for this behavior.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>How it <span>should </span>be going</h3>
                <p>We should use human language when talking about our feelings and mental health. Say that you're
                    scared of something, not that it's triggering your anxiety. Or that something is making you sad
                    instead of depressed. But most important: Be ready to really listen to one another and ask what you
                    can do for them. That's the way we as regular humans can have an honest and open conversation about
                    our feelings</p>

            <div>
                <h2>interactive <span>Elements</span></h2>
                <p>For the site, I wanted to use a scroll-jacking technique to not only present information in a
                    progressive disclosure manner but also to make the site more interesting and interactive. Next to
                    this addition I also added 2 "exercises" in which readers can bring their own input to the table.
                </p>
                <h3>A natural conversation</h3>
                <p>In the first element users are presented with two conversations. In it's core, the two conversations
                    are the same. The only difference between them is the language used. Users can interact by picking
                    the conversation they feel is the most human and get feedback on their choice.</p>
                <h3>Changing language</h3>
                <p>This element gives the user a qoute with 2 words that they can change by clicking on the words. Users
                    will actively change language in this exercise. The word "depression" will be changed into "a sad
                    and empty feeling" and "social-anxiety" will be changed into "behaviour and emotions when going
                    outside". Showcasing how easy it is to impactfully change your language.</p>

            <h2>The <span>prototype</span></h2>
            <p>Scince scroll-jacking is a pretty hard concept to succesfully prototype. I mimicked this effect by using
                After Effects. This way I could showcase the effect without the hassle of trying to code or prototype
                it. Have a look a the video below!</p>
