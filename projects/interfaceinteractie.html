                    <p>The Infinite Hotel is another project made for the minor Visual Interface Design at the
                        University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam. It's a project that I really like, not only because of
                        it's size but also because it involves a great (secret) love of mine: Math.</p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Learning about the Hilbert Hotel Paradox in a fun and interactive way.</p>
            <div>
                <p>The Infinite Hotel is a game in which users will learn about the Hilber Hotel Paradox. A mathematical
                    paradox which teaches us about the different kinds and sizes of inifinity and the problems that come
                    along with them. In short: It shows that even with infinite rooms, space can always be made for
                    more, defying our usual understanding of limits. This thought experiment highlights the strange and
                    counterintuitive nature of infinity in mathematics.

                    In this game, the user will be a night manager of this infinite hotel and will have to help
                    different guests get a room by learning about infinity and setting up fromulas.</p>

                <h2>Understanding <span>the case</span></h2>
                <p>The hardest part of this project was understanding the math. A part that I found particularly fun but
                    tough.</p>
                <h3>About the math</h3>
                <p>The Hilbert Hotel Paradox, introduced by German mathematician David Hilbert, is a thought experiment
                    that illustrates the counterintuitive nature of infinite sets. Imagine a hotel with infinitely many
                    rooms, all occupied. Surprisingly, it can still accommodate new guests! For example, to make room
                    for one new guest, each current guest moves to the next room (Room 1 to Room 2, Room 2 to Room 3,
                    and so on). Even if an infinite number of new guests arrive, they can be accommodated by shifting
                    each guest to double their room number (Room 1 to Room 2, Room 2 to Room 4, etc.), freeing all
                    odd-numbered rooms. This paradox highlights the strange properties of infinity, where “full” doesn’t
                    mean “no space left.”</p>
                <h3>Game Setup</h3>
                <p>This element gives the user a qoute with 2 words that they can change by clicking on the words. Users
                    will actively change language in this exercise. The word "depression" will be changed into "a sad
                    and empty feeling" and "social-anxiety" will be changed into "behaviour and emotions when going
                    outside". Showcasing how easy it is to impactfully change your language.</p>

            <h2>The <span>screencast</span></h2>
            <p>The game style was highly inspired by pixel indie games like Stardew Valley and Undertale. Below is a
                screencast of a walktrough of the entire game, including a little commentary.</p>

                <h2>The <span>Game</span></h2>
                <p>Prototyping something like this was more complex than I thought but ended up working out pretty well.
                    We endend up with a working Figma game in which feedback is giving on every choice and interaction
                    works alsmost as well as we wanted. Want to give it a try yourself? Try out our game through the
                    link below!</p>
