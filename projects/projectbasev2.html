            <p>The assignment was as follows:</p>
            <h3>Why Frutiger?</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>As a duo, you will collaboratively conceive a business. The business should 'sell'
                at least two things: itself and a service or product. Choose a topic, product, or service that you have
                an affinity for. You are forming a small enterprise, sole proprietorship, or start-up. Your objective is
                to design content for your company's website that aligns with the business goals, the users (target
                audience), user goals, and user queries.</p>

                <h2>interactive <span>Elements</span></h2>
                <p>For the site, I wanted to use a scroll-jacking technique to not only present information in a
                    progressive disclosure manner but also to make the site more interesting and interactive. Next to
                    this addition I also added 2 "exercises" in which readers can bring their own input to the table.
                </p>
                <h3>A natural conversation</h3>
                <p>In the first element users are presented with two conversations. In it's core, the two conversations
                    are the same. The only difference between them is the language used. Users can interact by picking
                    the conversation they feel is the most human and get feedback on their choice.</p>
                <h3>Changing language</h3>
                <p>This element gives the user a qoute with 2 words that they can change by clicking on the words. Users
                    will actively change language in this exercise. The word "depression" will be changed into "a sad
                    and empty feeling" and "social-anxiety" will be changed into "behaviour and emotions when going
                    outside". Showcasing how easy it is to impactfully change your language.</p>

            <p>The process began with extensive research into who Karel Martens is and what his work entails. This was
                followed by a period of experimentation, where various designs, ideas, and combinations were tested.
                Several color palettes, fonts, and different works were incorporated into my own design. The assignment
                also required creating a personal logo and icons. Karel Martens often uses bright colors, which I adore.
                Ultimately, I developed a website that I believe distinctly reflects both Karel Martens' style and my
                own.</p>

            <div>
                <p>The process began with extensive research into the content of the article and understanding the
                    difficulties we are facing these days regarding mental Health Discussion. In case you don't feel
                    like reading the entire article, I have made a quick summary on the side here.</p>
                <h3>How it's going <span>now</span></h3>
                <p>Therapytalk (Using clinic terms in regular conversations) is ubiquitous. Words like OCD, Autism,
                    Depression etc. are overly used in regular day-to-day conversations. A dangerous practice scine it
                    can allow people to wrongfully understand certain illnesses as well as wrongfully self-diagnose. The
                    Covid-19 pandemic and Social Media were and are a huge catalyst for this behavior.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>How it <span>should </span>be going</h3>
                <p>We should use human language when talking about our feelings and mental health. Say that you're
                    scared of something, not that it's triggering your anxiety. Or that something is making you sad
                    instead of depressed. But most important: Be ready to really listen to one another and ask what you
                    can do for them. That's the way we as regular humans can have an honest and open conversation about
                    our feelings</p>
