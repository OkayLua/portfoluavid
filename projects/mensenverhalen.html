                <p>Exposition & Storytelling</p>
                <p>April 2023</p>
                <p>'Mensen Verhalen' is something completely different; It's an prototype exhibition i set up together
                    with Lanxiang Vermeulen & Vivanne Hoogendam.</p>

            <h2>The <span>preparations</span></h2>
            <p>Bringing people together through books: That was the idea that set everything in motion. With Lanxiang's
                passion for photography, Vivanne's love for books, and my dedication to stage design and storytelling,
                we successfully created this mini/prototype exhibition.</p>
            <img src="images/mvprototype.png" alt="">
            <h3>The plan</h3>
            <p>In addition to interviewing 50 people on the street about their reading habits and favorite books, we
                highlighted the stories of 5 individuals who truly stood out. These 5 people, representing different
                generations, all shared a love for reading. Each person was given their own "room," designed to reflect
                their story, creating a unique and personal world for visitors to experience. After designing all the
                rooms, the last 4 days were a whirlwind of cutting, pasting, and assembling. It was a period of
                round-the-clock effort, but in the final seconds, it all came together: a prototype that we were
                genuinely proud of.</p>
            <h3>Reception</h3>
            <p>We never expected that the three of us could create something so impressive in just two and a half weeks.
                The feedback was overwhelmingly positive. The stories left by visitors on the wall at "Story Square,"
                where everyone could share their own stories , were a joy to read. Thanks to this project, we also
                received the Audience Award at the project market.</p>
